          Why Whole Foods Are a Healthy Choice for Your Dog
        </h2>
        <section class="whole-content">
          <p>
            Whole foods are foods that are close to their natural state, with
            little to no processing and are easy for your dog to digest.
            Examples include fresh meats like chicken or beef, vegetables like
            carrots and sweet potatoes, and fruits like blueberries. Feeding
            whole foods alongside a balanced diet can provide a variety of
            benefits for your dog's overall health.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whole foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that
            support strong bones, healthy skin and coat, and a robust immune
            system. They also provide natural sources of protein and fiber,
            which can help with digestion and maintaining a healthy weight. By
            including whole foods, you can supplement your dog's diet in a way
            that is natural, transparent, and often easier for owners to
            understand compared to highly processed foods.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, not all human foods are safe for dogs, and some can be
            toxic even in small amounts. The following sections break down which
            whole foods are recommended for dogs and which should always be
            avoided, helping you make safe and informed choices for your furry
            friend.

          Even small amounts of some foods can be harmful to dogs, and reactions
          can vary depending on your dog's size, age, and overall health. If
          your dog accidentally eats something on this list, it's important to
          monitor them closely and contact your vet as soon as possible for
          advice. Prompt guidance can help ensure your dog gets the right care
          and support.
